installing rails isn't working on bluehost!!!!!!!!

fuck this is annoying

installation of rails through cPanel hangs. So does trying to
install it through the cmd line after ssh-ing in

consider just building a django site, hosting it on localhost,
and then pushing it to some other provider (since Bluehost
sucks for django apparently)

setting up ssh is very tedious.

waiting for the account to be verified right now. Not sure if 
I can use my password to log in or if I need to generate a 
new public / private key pair to allow myself access.

not sure how to incorporate a new private/public key pair into 
my local keystore

I guess I keep the private key on my side?

anyway now I can ssh into their server with my bluehost passwrd.
